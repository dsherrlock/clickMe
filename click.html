				I just wanted to tell you how lucky I am to be on your side. 
				<br><br>
				I also wanted to say sorry I wasn't able to attend on time on your MDA. I was late huhu. 
				Also for leaving the gc without telling you about it first. Sorryyy. I didn't mean anything about that.
				<br><br>
				I hope na kung ano man yung iniisip mo ngayon eh you find your peace of mind. If may bumabagabag sa isip mo please dont hesitate to tell me.
				I'll always be here for you and I'm happy to listen.
				<br><br>
				I'm very grateful na makilala kita. If there's something that best defines what perfect is, it's you. 
				<br>
				Thanks for existing!
